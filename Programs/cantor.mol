#The purpose of this program is to
 impliment the Cantor pairing 
 function. It takes in two non-negative
 integers and produces a unique integer.
 The purpose of this function is to
 show a possible implimentation of 
 matricies as hash maps where the
 row and the column of an individual 
 data point of a matrix are used as the
 inputs Cantor pairing function.#

fn main(int m, int n) int {
    return ((m + n) * (m + n + 1) / 2) + n;
}
