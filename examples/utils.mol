#The purpose of this program is to define functions
 that are useful for ease of programming, syntatic
 sugar. I plan on modifying and updating this document 
 frequently.                                       #

fn main() bool {
    return true;
}

fn append(vct list, int item) vct{
    return list[len(list)] = item;
}

fn buildBlankMAT(int rows, int columns) mat{
    mat a = [];
    a[rows;columns] = 0;
    return a;
}
