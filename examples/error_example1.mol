# The second type of error is a scanning error. To be exact, the scanning error
  in this file is when there is an integer that has a max number of digits in
  an integer than what is allowed, but the absolute value of integer exceeds 
  the maximum size of an integer. This error is different that the error in
  error_example0 because of how Mol scans and checks digits.#
