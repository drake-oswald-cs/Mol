#This program is used as an example
 of the usage of matricies. The
 purpose of this program is to 
 reflect a 2-D shape about the 
 y-axis. It takes as input a matrix
 of size m x 2, as many rows as 
 needed with two columns. The 
 program outputs a matrix that
 corresponds to the rotated shape.
 Note that each row in the matrix
 represents a point [x y].       #

fn main(mat shape) mat {
    
    return shape * [1 -1];

}
